#Monkey Phone

###Make an API call!

This is one of a series of 3 beginner friendly projects for 24 Pull Requests: http://24pullrequests.com/.

We want you to help us build a site that gathers information from some public APIs. We think the Guardian one is perfect for beginners but check out Twitter if you want something else: http://explorer.content.guardianapis.com/?api-key=test

If want help for where to start, check out JQuery and JQuery's awesome ajax function: 

```
$.ajax({
	type: ...,
	url: ...,
	success: ...
});
```

Or if you want to try it without, try the Javascript native:

```
XMLHttpRequest()
```

Other than that, do whatever you think is best. You can use the APIs to do whatever you want!

The Founders and Coders crew are all more than happy to offer any help, advice, or direction. Feel free to message any of us. Find us here: https://github.com/foundersandcoders.
